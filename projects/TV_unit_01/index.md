_WINTER 02.-03.2016._ WOODEN TV cabinet with cable management.. _W100×H100×D100 cm._ The Lexington system has strong architectural connotations. It is characterized by wall-mounted and floor-to-ceiling, onto which shelves and storage units with leaf doors, drawers or flap doors are hooked at the desired height. The upright is available in a champagne or ardesia painted finish, or in gold oak and black elm, with a warmer feeling. In the ceiling upright version, the system offers the possibility of designing double-sided compositions finished on both sides, ideal in the center of the room also for dividing spaces. Lexington is also available in a night system version.
